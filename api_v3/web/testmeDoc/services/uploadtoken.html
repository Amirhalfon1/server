	 Chunks can be uploaded in parallel and they will be appended according to their resumeAt position.
	 A parallel upload session should have three stages:
	 1. A single upload with resume=false and finalChunk=false
	 2. Parallel upload requests each with resume=true,finalChunk=false and the expected resumetAt position.
	 If a chunk fails to upload it can be re-uploaded.
	 3. After all of the chunks have been uploaded a final chunk (can be of zero size) should be uploaded 
	 with resume=true, finalChunk=true and the expected resumeAt position. In case an UPLOAD_TOKEN_CANNOT_MATCH_EXPECTED_SIZE exception
	 has been returned (indicating not all of the chunks were appended yet) the final request can be retried.</td>
